            French food isn't all about haute cuisine and fine dining—some of the
            best food to enjoy in Paris can be bought from a humble boulangerie
            for just a couple of euros. Bite into a buttery croissant, savour a
            crunchy baguette, or try your hand at making the colourful macaron.
            Here’s our pick of the gastronomic highlights.

            Walk past any bakery in the wee hours of the morning and you’ll be
            instantly spellbound by the warm buttery smell of fresh croissants
            escaping from the air vents at pavement level. This is your cue to
            step in and get your golden prize, which you can tuck into and
            savour on your morning walk as the city awakens. Sadly, fewer and
            fewer French bakeries make their croissants from scratch – they buy
            them frozen instead – so it’s worth asking to make sure your
            boulanger still engages in that noble, delicious craft.

            For the quintessential bistrot dish, steak frites, head to one of
            Paris’ atmospheric French brasseries, complete with brass fittings,
            linen tablecloths (red gingham optional) and smart, aproned waiting
            staff. These restaurants are so integral to the city’s dining scene,
            even multi-Michelin-starred chef Alain Ducasse has opened one:
            Champeaux in Les Halles.

            Until supreme patissier Pierre Hermé reinvented these small, smooth
          meringues filled with ganache, they were a fairly unassuming item in
          the extensive range of French patisserie, coming in just four
          flavours: vanilla, chocolate, coffee and raspberry. This delicate
          pastry has taken the world by storm but its birthplace is resolutely
          Paris. Hermé took these colourful treats to another level with
          flavours such as lemon, orange blossom and Corsican honey (this is
          called the Jardin de l’Atlas) and rose, lychee and raspberry (the
          Ispahan). For those who like one flavour only, his ‘Infiniment’ range
          takes one ingredient – lemon, chocolate, coffee and many others – and
          uses it to create different layers of flavour in one macaron. Macarons
          are two-bite delights, but it is worth seeking them out from reputable
          pastry shops that actually make their own – many just hop on the
          bandwagon and sell factory-made ones that aren’t worth your time or
          dime – and go easy on the rainbow-style food colourings. Try our
          chocolate macarons for a sweet treat that goes perfectly with tea.

            The French aren’t known for embracing the cuisine of other cultures,
          but Paris is currenlty undergoing a gastronomic revolution and the
          focus of many chefs is Israeli food. One of the hottest tables in town
          is at Balagan where chefs Assaf Granit and Dan Yosha and their team
          are serving fresh, vibrant vegetable, fish and meat dishes lifted with
          perfectly pitched spices, tahini and citrus. For the best seat in the
          house, grab a stool at the kitchen counter and enjoy the chefs’
          theatrics as they serve dishes, sing and knock back shots of cucumber
          and mint-enhanced absinthe. Check out our Mediterranean and Jewish
          recipes for inspiration on cooking Israeli-inspired dishes. Falafel is
          Israel's national dish, so try making our easy falafel recipe. It
          tastes a thousand times better than the shop-bought options.

            Is it really an orange? As you slice into its shell, you soon realise
          patissier Cédric Grolet’s extraordinary desserts are something very
          special – this is actually mousse filled with mandarin and timut
          pepper compote. At just 32 years old, Grolet has established a
          worldwide following (mostly thanks to his Instagram account) for his
          fruit desserts, which look every bit like the real thing. Each one
          takes around a week to complete, from the outer shell made with cocoa
          butter, to the mousse and compote inside. Grolet and his team make
          around 200 a day, serving only the best to teatime guests at Le
          Meurice, a luxury hotel on the Rue de Rivoli. Check out our French
