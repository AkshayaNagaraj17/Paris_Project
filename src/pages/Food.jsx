            <p className="text-xl font-medium w-3/4 mx-auto my-20 font-serif">French food isn't all about haute cuisine and fine dining—some of the best food to enjoy in Paris can be bought from a humble boulangerie for just a couple of euros. Bite into a buttery croissant, savour a crunchy baguette, or try your hand at making the colourful macaron, which takes more effort but is worth every second. Here's our pick of the gastronomic highlights.

                <p>Walk past any bakery in the wee hours of the morning and you’ll be instantly spellbound by the warm buttery smell of fresh croissants escaping from the air vents at pavement level. This is your cue to step in and get your golden prize, which you can tuck into and savour on your morning walk as the city awakens. Sadly, fewer and fewer French bakeries make their croissants from scratch – they buy them frozen instead – so it’s worth asking to make sure your boulanger still engages in that noble, delicious craft.</p>

                <p>For the quintessential bistrot dish, steak frites, head to one of Paris’ atmospheric French brasseries, complete with brass fittings, linen tablecloths (red gingham optional) and smart, aproned waiting staff. These restaurants are so integral to the city’s dining scene, even multi-Michelin-starred chef Alain Ducasse has opened one: Champeaux in Les Halles.</p>

                <h1>3. Macarons</h1>
                <img src="./images/fo3.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>Until supreme patissier Pierre Hermé reinvented these small, smooth meringues filled with ganache, they were a fairly unassuming item in the extensive range of French patisserie, coming in just four flavours: vanilla, chocolate, coffee and raspberry. This delicate pastry has taken the world by storm but its birthplace is resolutely Paris.

Hermé took these colourful treats to another level with flavours such as lemon, orange blossom and Corsican honey (this is called the Jardin de l’Atlas) and rose, lychee and raspberry (the Ispahan). For those who like one flavour only, his ‘Infiniment’ range takes one ingredient – lemon, chocolate, coffee and many others – and uses it to create different layers of flavour in one macaron. Macarons are two-bite delights, but it is worth seeking them out from reputable pastry shops that actually make their own – many just hop on the bandwagon and sell factory-made ones that aren’t worth your time or dime – and go easy on the rainbow-style food colourings.

Try our chocolate macarons for a sweet treat that goes perfectly with tea.</p>

                <h1>4. Israeli food</h1>
                <img src="./images/fo4.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>The French aren’t known for embracing the cuisine of other cultures, but Paris is currenlty undergoing a gastronomic revolution and the focus of many chefs is Israeli food. One of the hottest tables in town is at Balagan where chefs Assaf Granit and Dan Yosha and their team are serving fresh, vibrant vegetable, fish and meat dishes lifted with perfectly pitched spices, tahini and citrus.

For the best seat in the house, grab a stool at the kitchen counter and enjoy the chefs’ theatrics as they serve dishes, sing and knock back shots of cucumber and mint-enhanced absinthe.

                <h1>5. Cédric Grolet’s Patisserie</h1>
                <img src="./images/fo5.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>Is it really an orange? As you slice into its shell, you soon realise patissier Cédric Grolet’s extraordinary desserts are something very special – this is actually mousse filled with mandarin and timut pepper compote. At just 32 years old, Grolet has established a worldwide following (mostly thanks to his Instagram account) for his fruit desserts, which look every bit like the real thing.

Each one takes around a week to complete, from the outer shell made with cocoa butter, to the mousse and compote inside. Grolet and his team make around 200 a day, serving only the best to teatime guests at Le Meurice, a luxury hotel on the Rue de Rivoli.
